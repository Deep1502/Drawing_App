# Drawing App
This project is inspired from Microsoft Paint application. I decided to create a simple paint application using HTML canvas and JavaScript. In this project the user can draw lines of different widths and of different colors.

Did mistake in drawing? No problem, the project also offers eraser by which user can erase the lines.

Want to start over? User can also clear the canvas and start their drawing fresh.

Done with the drawing? Save it in image format.
